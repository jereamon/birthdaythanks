      I wanted to say thank you for the birthday wishes, card, and giftcard! I appreciate
      the well wishes and will put the gift card to good use.

    <p>The photos of me are from when I went to visit the Leavenworth area and went
      on several fun hikes.

    <p>I'm thoroughly looking forward to summer and am starting to plan a few different
      road trips. It would be fun for all of us to go somewhere for the Fourth of
      July again. I would really like to get back to the Olympic National Park coast.

      Anyways, thanks again!
